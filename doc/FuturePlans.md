## Future Plans for Avalytics

1. Our main vision for Avalytics is to grow it into an "Entrance gate" for all things Avalanche C-chain,  rather than being an "Output only" type of application. To this end, the app can leverage on 1Inch protocol/API's or even TraderJOE's smart contracts to enable users to buy and sell tokens in the c-chain.
2. Users can be allowed to download source data used in creating the visualizations, possibly at a minor charge, opening the door for revenue and datanomics.
3. A full-fledged datanomics model can be created, that will enable monetization from the Avalytics app. Basic ideas include selling the source data, computed data, [rendered charts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10721884/render-html-to-an-image/46243263#46243263), and dynamically constructed full reports, in return for AVAX tokens. A subscription-based model can also be adopted, as in [Token Metrics](https://tokenmetrics.com), possibly in a decentralized way, using systems such as [SuperFluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/home). Generated reports can be stored on [decentalized IPFS cloud using Moralis API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRjFn__kVJM). If a token is to be issued for Avalytics, a full-fledged [tokenomics design](https://maxyampolsky.medium.com/how-to-design-tokenomics-for-your-cryptocurrency-the-basics-of-creating-your-token-9a0375cb9479) is needed, which mitigates against different types of technical, legal, economic, and social risks, and ensures economics value and growth. For example, in both datanomics and tokenomics design, it is important to make sure not to distribute tokens to users randomly, as this may be [labeled as lottery and sued by some users](https://cryptobriefing.com/a-guy-put-10-ethereum-defi-app/).
4. Users can be allowed to select other [color palettes](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/website-color-palettes/) for the visualizations. These palettes can include pallets that are suitable for [color blindness](https://www.color-blindness.com/), similar to [R packages for color blindness](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/top-r-color-palettes-to-know-for-great-data-visualization/). Another possibility is to use [color palettes inspired by photos of nature](https://sarahrenaeclark.com/color-palettes/).
5. Several other analyses categories and types can be added to the app. These extensions include analysis of [NFTs](https://dune.xyz/panta_rhei/NFt), [Whales](https://www.whalestats.com/analysis-of-the-top-1000-avalanche-wallets), [MemPools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhAelJJtr4k), Bridges, and other networks, in comparison and conjunction with Avalanche C-Chain. There can even be detailed analytics for Avalanche Dapps, as in the top Dapp directory, [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/), which -as of January 2022- does not list [Avalanche Dapps](https://dappradar.com/search/avalanche), returning empty results page.
6. Sliding news tickers can be added, at least as a footer in the main Dashboard screen, that would display prices of Avalanche C-Chain tokens dynamically. Several Javascript libraries can be used to this end, including [react-ticker](https://github.com/AndreasFaust/react-ticker), [dynamic-marquee](https://github.com/tjenkinson/dynamic-marquee), and [react-native-text-ticker](https://github.com/deanhet/react-native-text-ticker).
7. Basic statistical metrics, such as standard deviation, [skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness), and [kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis), tracked and plotted over time, can (a) give an approximation of the distribution function, and (b) provide insights into where the price may be moving next.
8. Several other calculations, especially with respect to volatiliy, and specifically the ["VIX Index"](https://youtu.be/56gI9mMOczw) and other [Fear & Greed indicators](https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/) calculations can be done through collecting more data with other API, such as [Binance Market Data endpoints](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md#market-data-endpoints) and [FTX Grouped Orderbooks](https://docs.ftx.com/#grouped-orderbooks).
9. Other visual analytics methods can be implemented using alternative libraries, including Python visualization/animation/storytelling libraries (such as [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html)) whose output may be displayed on the frontend within Avalytics.
10. Advanced data analytics methods and [machine learning (ML)](https://www.coursera.org/collections/machine-learning) algorithms, including predictive and even prescriptive analytics, can be implemented within Avalytics into the future, using some of the [top data science software libraries](https://towardsdatascience.com/8-booming-data-science-libraries-you-must-watch-out-in-2022-cec2dbb42437).
11. Computed statistics can be published on [ChainLink](https://chain.link) and other oracles. One simple example would be publishing the correlation between AVAX and ETH (or WETH.e) prices as feeds.
12. Computed statistics can be published as [webhooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41NOoEz3Tzc), allowing RPA tools such as [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [CaptainData](https://app.captaindata.co), [Konnectzit](https://app.konnectzit.com) and [Hexomatic](https://hexomatic.com) to connect to these hooks and do many interesting things, including automated notification/signal/alert push messages to social media.
13. Presented visualizations and results can be described automatically using AI-generated text narrations, using [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) or other text-generation/NLP (Natural Language Processing) libraries, or APIs that build on those libraries, such as the [Rytr API](https://rytr.me/developers/api#register) for automated text generation. Such text can also be transformed into voice through text-to-speech technology and libraries.
14. On the documentation side, the developed code, especially the Javascript code can be visually documented using [SmartDraw's Automated Class Diagrams Extensions](htpps://www.smartdraw.com/developers/extensions/class-diagram.htm)
15. On the documentation side, the documentation can be put into a better format using [GitBook](https://gitbook.com), just like the [GitBook documentation of TraderJoe](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/main/welcome/master).
16. Many other opportunities for improvement have been identified and listed through brain storming sessions and are available as internal notes.
