## Technology/Tool Stack

- For the **backend data querying and storage**, [Moralis API and server](https://moralis.io) were used.
- For the **backend data processing**, [Python](https://python.org) language and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) ML library were used.
- For the **backend cloud service**, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) was used.
- For the **frontend app**, [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) Javascript library was used. 
- For the **frontend visual analytics**, [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [Flourish Studio](https://flourish.studio) Javascript libraries/platofmrs were used. The [D3 Visualization Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) at [Observable HQ](https://observablehq.com/@d3/) provides sample source codes for all the essential charts of D3.js, including those implemented in Avalytics.
- **Token images** were obtained from [CoinGecko](https://coingecko.com).
