<hline>
</hline>

## Executive Summary
  
[Avalytics app](https://renatomrocha.github.io/Moralis_Avax_Hackathon/) is **an analytics dashboard to** interactively and dynamically **display changes in prices and market caps** of tokens on the [Avalanche C-Chain](https://uniswap.org) blockchain. The dashboard also displays other charts that give analytical insights into the [liquidity pools](https://traderjoexyz.com/pool) in the [TraderJoe](https://traderjoexyz.com) decentralized exchange (DEX). 

The app was designed, developed, and implemented during the period of [Moralis+Avalanche Hackathon](https://moralis.io/avalanche-hackathon/) by the project team. This documentation describes the application and presents a blue print of how the system can be developed into the future over an extended time period. The design also provides a template for Avalanche and other blockchains on how a dashboard with innovative features can be developed to analyze on-chain and possibly other data.
